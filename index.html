          <h4><span>2009 - June 2010</span><br />Andrew and Jessica begin hanging out in 2009, when Andrew asks Jessica out...to a FroYo run at a campus eatery.  Over the next few years, Andrew uses excuses like “I crave ramen” and “Sprinkles Cupcakes is offering a free cupcake promotion!” to spend time together. (Andrew now admits that he doesn’t really like cupcakes, much to Jessica’s chagrin.)</h4>

          <h4><span>2009 - June 2010</span><br />Jessica lives in a sorority house which does not offer food on weekends. Lacking a car, Jessica often has limited dinner options, and she misses Asian food.  Thus, she excitedly takes Andrew up on his offers to drive and pay for ramen and pho (which she completely mispronounces, but Andrew is too charmed by her cuteness to correct her).</h4>

          <h4><span>June 16, 2010</span><br />At a summer Christian Fellowship retreat at Catalina Island, Andrew confesses to Jessica his true feelings about her. This involves a multi-page letter, stuttering, and abashed looks.  Poor Andrew is shot down, as Jessica claims that she is not ready for a relationship and would rather keep the friendship as is.</h4>

          <h4 class="small"><span>Spring 2011</span><br />By now, Andrew has graduated and Jessica has just returned from 10 weeks studying abroad in Spain. Andrew and Jessica begin spending time together again, and Andrew is actively trying to guard his heart from falling head over heels for Jessica once again. However, Jessica finds herself inexplicably wanting to chat and hang out with Andrew more and more.  Finally, after weeks of trying to deny her own feelings, Jessica admits to Andrew: “Well, maybe it’s not a bad thing that we are spending so much time together.”  From this vague statement, Andrew is expected to infer that Jessica indeed had feelings and wants to date Andrew.  Luckily, Andrew’s ego is big enough to infer such a thing.</h4>

Andrew realizes this marks the tragic end of free sorority house food (they have their own chef!) and free laundry. On the other hand, he no longer is expected to live a college student’s schedule and won’t have to feel bad for falling asleep before Jessica’s Formals, which commence at 11 pm.</h4>

He then directs Jessica to a webpage where he listed 365 reasons why he loves her (boy did that take a long time to come up with!) Lunch and flowers are delivered to Jessica’s office, and a private car is sent to pick her up after work.  Jessica realizes it’s a big day. The chauffeur drives Jessica to La Folie, a restaurant where Jessica and Andrew had their first date (after Jessica admitted her feelings, before Andrew formally asked her out). Andrew is waiting in the private room, and after a waitress escorts Jessica there, Andrew gets down on one knee and proposes. She says yes!!! After dinner, Andrew surprises Jessica by inviting a small group of friends to celebrate the engagement.</h4>

          <p>The Los Altos History Museum is unsurprisingly located in Los Altos, CA, about 40 miles south of San Francisco. The nearest airport is San Jose Airport (SJC), though San Francisco Airport (SFO) is also convenient.
</p>
<div class="line-seperator"></div>
<p>The outdoor ceremony will promptly begin at 4:30pm, and dinner and dancing will follow. Warm weather is expected, with historical averages of about 68°F, but because the ceremony and reception are outdoors, please prepare accordingly. Ample parking will be available on site.

              <h4>Best Man</h4>
              <p>Justin Kao has been Andrew’s brother for 24 long years. While Andrew has always looked up to big brother, Andrew has had to act as the mature one more often than not, such as when he chose to let Justin beat him at video games to avoid subjecting the entire family to fussy Justin. Looking up to Justin also proves to be expensive, as Justin was the one to introduce Andrew to the world of designer jeans, fine dining, and 18th century Persian rugs (just kidding). Luckily, Justin also taught Andrew how to marry someone out of his league; Justin and his wife Tiffany have a Shiba Inu son named Matcha.</p>

              <p>Daniel Kim and Andrew first met in 8th grade; Daniel was new to school and looking for friends, and Andrew really enjoyed the lunches Mrs. Kim packed. In 10th grade, they started becoming close friends by lamenting over common tragedies: girls, AP classes, and strict Asian mothers. Daniel went through a major rebirth at MIT, where he started going by “Dan,” danced hip-hop, and received Asian popstar haircuts. Being the loving person he is, Andrew has forgiven these missteps and is elated that they have grown to become close brothers in Christ. Dan(iel) is currently enrolled at Stanford’s MD/PhD program. He will also be enrolled next year. And the next. And the next.</p>

              <p>Tim Sun is Andrew’s bestie from Stanford. Actually, they really are not “besties,” but because Jessica has so many best friends/besties/BFFs, Andrew would like one too. Anyway, Andrew met Tim through InterVarsity. In fact, during one of the first InterVarsity events Andrew attended, Tim gave a testimony about trying to serve God while pursuing a banking internship at Morgan Stanley. From that moment forth, Andrew decided to be friends with Tim because rich friends are always good to have. Andrew and Tim have bonded over the years due to their shared interests in Jesus, playing basketball, Stanford football, and career aspirations (they are both ex-economic consultants!). Tim now attends business school at Sloan (MIT) where he spends more time fending off women than actually studying.</p>

              <h4>Groomsman</h4>
              <p>Will Choi is Andrew’s friend from college and current roommate. During this past year as roommates, Will buys delicious TV dinners from Trader Joe’s (or Mollie Stones when he wants to live large), always leaves the toilet seat up, and lets Andrew watch all the sports he wants without nagging. Andrew is hopeful that his future roommate will be as accommodating. Most importantly, Will agreed to let Andrew take the “lucky” room in their apartment/house/weird dwelling; the previous tenant of that room moved out upon getting married, and now Andrew will follow suit. Will is counting down the days til Andrew moves out so he can take over. Will is the co-founder of a mindblowing startup - go look up “Aviate” for Android devices (who needs PR firms when you can just have Andrew give you free press on his wedding website?) - and in his free time, slaves away building websites for Andrew.</p>

              <p>Maid of Honor: Best friends since elementary school, Amanda and Jessica lived around the corner from each other in La Canada. The two would walk to elementary school, bake shortbread, serve on student government, play soccer, and do homework together. From sharing books, building forts, carpooling to high school, freezing in Maine, to traveling in Europe together, Amanda and Jessica were always looking for new adventures. Most importantly, through the ups and downs, they always knew who they could count on and call; even if they hadn't talked for a while, it would feel as though no time had passed since they were last together. Throughout their friendship, Amanda has been a faithful prayer warrior for Jessica. Jessica would not be where she is or who she is today without Amanda!</p>

              <h4>Bridesmaid</h4>
              <p>Jacqueline Holt and Jessica became best friends at Stanford, doing nearly everything the same. Since living in the same freshman dorm, declaring the same major, joining the same sorority, serving on the same InterVarsity ministry team, leading sorority small group together, studying abroad in Spain together, and rooming together, Jacqueline and Jessica are like two peas in a pod. Jacqueline has been the emotional backbone to Jessica!! She is probably the most empathetic, caring person you will ever meet. In fact, Jacqueline was critical in helping Jessica to achieve her long-time aspiration of exuding a more of a “Feeler”* personality. Jessica is ever thankful to Jacqueline for walking beside her through college as a sister in Christ. *See Meyer’s Brigg Test results</p>

              <h4>Bridesmaid</h4>
              <p>Bridesmaid: Kimberly Chang, fondly known as Kimbo, constitutes the other half of the token asian besties in their mostly blond-headed sorority; hence all the blonde friends... Some of their finer moments included eating a Costco-size chunk of Gouda cheese with a box of Ritz crackers together in their two-room double while watching old episodes of the OC. Together with Jacqueline, Kimbo nearly converted Jessica into being a San Francisco Giants fan; luckily, Andrew has since rescued Jessica and reclaimed her as a LA sports fan. Kimbo was able to receive some of the fruits of Andrew’s pursuit of Jessica; more often than not, Andrew would deliver boba to Jessica and pick up one for Kimbo, too. Now working blocks away from each other in the SF Financial District, Kimbo and Jessica enjoy their near-daily morning coffee dates at the Coffee Bean on Montgomery and Bush Streets. Kimbo also played an integral role in the proposal story, so you should ask her about it!</p>

              <h4>Bridesmaid</h4>
              <p>Elise Gibbs is yet another bestie from Stanford and has been Jessica’s roommate for the past two years. It is surprising that Elise has not gotten tired of Jessica’s random antics yet! Jessica will be sad to be separated from this dream team roomie pairing. Elise and Jessica enjoy bedazzling, eating gummy vitamins, leaving each other colorful love notes, pretending to do their homework and real-work-work, and lounging around their apartment. Elise is also Jessica’s free therapist as Elise earns her Doctor of Psychology from her Stanford program. Elise and Andrew also have a special relationship, rehashing the details of the Bachelorette every Tuesday morning.  Elise is credited for strangely forcing Jessica into nice clothes the morning of her surprise proposal, as Jessica was planning to sleep in that day and wear jeans. As a roommate, Elise orders a weekly box of farm-to-table organic produce, always leaves the toilet seat down, and never wastes her time watching sports. Jessica is hopeful that her future roommate will be as accommodating. </p>
